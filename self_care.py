# using tuples
#   enumerate()
#         Ex. 1; list(enumerate(someotherlist))
#         Ex. 2: for a, b in enumerate(list)
#       Gives you a list of tuples (index, item), etc
#           the a, b above is unpacking each typle pair
#   zip()
#   returning multiple variables
# #   Example:
# def f():
#     return 1, 2  # This is called tuple packing

# a, b = f()  # This is called tuple unpacking

# # exception handling
# `try` blocks give you a space to do something that may raise an exception
# (cause an error).
#     (1) if there is an error, deal with it in the `except` block
#     (2) if there is not an error, you can optionally use an `else` block
#     (3) `finally` can be used to catch errors from the except block and run
#     whether `try` raises an error or not.
#     (4) generally best to have as little happening in your `try` block as
# necessary
# Pattern:
# try:
#     [attempt something exception prone here]
# except:
#     [handle the exception]
# else: (optional)
#     [what to do if there is no exception]
# finally: (optional)
#     [what to do whether there is an exception or not]


#   `except Exception as e` gives you access to the exception in the `e`

# # Example 1:
# try:  # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
#     1/0
# except Exception as e:
#     print("The variable name 'e' is your exception: {}".format(e))

# # Example 2:
# try:  # IndexError: list index out of range
#     print([1, 2][2])
# except Exception as e:
#     print("The variable name 'e' is your exception: {}".format(e))

# # Example 3
# try:  # ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10
#     print(int("this will not work"))
# except Exception as e:
#     print("The variable name 'e' is your exception: {}".format(e))


# # misc.
# raise
# assert

# isinstance(check_this, see_if_this)
#   returns True/False
#   test for str, int, float, list, dict, tuple, etc.
# Examples:
# isinstance([1, 2, 3], list)  # True
# isinstance(1, list)  # False

# boilerplate code
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
